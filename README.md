# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis on Sales Dataset

This project performs a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a Sales dataset to uncover key insights, trends, and patterns across shipping modes, customer segments, product categories, and geographic locations.

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes records of customer orders containing:
- **Customer Info**: Name, Segment, ID
- **Order Info**: Order ID, Order Date, Ship Mode, Shipping Date
- **Geography**: Country, State, Region, City, Postal Code
- **Product Info**: Category, Sub-Category, Product Name
- **Sales Info**: Sales value, etc.

🔢 **Total Rows**: *e.g.* 9994  
🔣 **Total Columns**: 18

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: Visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment

---

## 🧪 Steps Performed

### 🔍 1. Data Loading & Initial Exploration
- Loaded dataset using `pandas.read_csv()`
- Examined structure using `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.head()`
- Identified and handled missing values

### 📊 2. Univariate Analysis
- Distribution of:
  - Sales
  - Ship Mode
  - Segment
  - Category
- Visualized using histograms and countplots

### 📈 3. Bivariate Analysis
- Explored relationships between:
  - Sales vs Ship Mode
  - Sales vs Segment
  - Sales vs Category
- Visualized using bar plots and boxplots

### 📌 4. Correlation Analysis
- Plotted a **correlation heatmap** of numerical features

### 🚨 5. Outlier Detection
- Used **boxplots** to detect outliers in Sales

### 🧹 6. Handling Missing Values
- Imputed missing values using **median** (for numerical) and **mode** (for categorical)

### 📋 7. Feature Analysis
- Total and average Sales per:
  - Sub-Category
  - State
  - Region
- Grouped bar plots and sorted bar charts

---

## 🔎 Key Findings

- **Sales are right-skewed** with many low-value transactions and a few high outliers.
- **Standard Class** is the most common ship mode, while **Same Day** is least used.
- The **Corporate** segment tends to generate higher average sales.
- **Technology** category contributes the most in terms of revenue.
- Regions and states show varied performance, useful for **targeted marketing**.
- Minimal missing data, handled efficiently.
